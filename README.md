## Introduction
This project is a reproduction of paper: 

"The number of k-mer matches between two DNA sequences as a function of k and applications to estimate phylogenetic distances" [paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0228070).

This code is not original implement of the paper. Original implement by the author is in c++. The github homepage is [here](https://github.com/burkhard-morgenstern/Slope-SpaM).
